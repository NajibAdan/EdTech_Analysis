# Edtech Analysis
## Introduction
A fictional EdTech company is focusing on accelerating its growth by increasing the number of enrolled users.

Therefore, I was asked to analyze various aspects of customer acquisition to see the status of new usersâ€™ growth in your company. The dataset was obtained from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nxtwaveda/data-analyst). 

## Overview of the dataset
The dataset contains 5 CSV files containg:
- `lead_basic_details`: Contains the basic details of leads
- `sales_managers_assigned_leads_details`: Contains the details of the senior and junior sales managers and their assigned leads.
- `leads_interaction_details`: Contains the details of call interactions of junior sales managers with the leads.Lead interaction details
- `leads_demo_watched_details`: Contains the details of the demo session watched by the leads.
- `leads_reasons_for_no_interest`: Contains the details of the reasons given by the leads for their lack of interest.

## Insights:
- 18% of leads are successfully converted while 45% of leads dropped out at the earliest introduction stage.
- Leads who dropped out of the customer acquisition flow cited affordability, preferring offline classes and not being in interested in the subject.
- Majority of the leads who cited affordability are aged between 22-25 and are currently looking for a job. The company can look into having discussion with the leads' parents to see if they can support or introduce a more affordable payment model.
- The company could set up centres at Visakhapatnam, Kochi, Hyderabad and Mumbai if they wanted to better accomodate the clients who preferred physicals classes.
- The demo videos are not engaging as leads or even successfully converted leads rarely ever watched the entirety of the demo. 
- Email Marketing has the most successfully converted leads even though it was the lowest generating source for all the leads.
